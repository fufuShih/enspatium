# Enspatium

Enspatium is a self-hosted platform for managing content, storage, and collaboration through one unified concept: **Everything is a Space.**


## Project Structure

- `apps` — deployable frontend applications
- `packages` — Node.js server and shared packages

## Development

```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The server exposes `GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/health`.

## API generation

After changing backend route schemas, run from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm generate:api
```

This exports `packages/server/openapi.json` from the Fastify TypeBox schemas, then generates TypeScript request/response types, fetch functions, and TanStack Query hooks in `apps/web/src/api/generated.ts`. No running server, database, or environment configuration is needed. Keep both generated files in version control; do not edit them manually.

Each REST route has a stable `operationId`, such as `listSpaces` or `createSpace`. Raw Git transport routes are excluded. The running backend also serves the specification at `GET /openapi.json`.

```tsx
import { useListSpaces, useCreateSpace } from './api/generated'

// Inside a component under the existing QueryClientProvider:
const spaces = useListSpaces('my-account')
const create = useCreateSpace()
const handleCreate = () => create.mutate({
  namespaceSlug: 'my-account',
  data: { name: 'Demo', slug: 'demo', type: 'git' },
})
```

Call mutations from event handlers. Generated requests use `/api` and include session cookies. Vite proxies `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/*`; production hosting should provide the same reverse proxy. The current UI continues using mock data until these hooks are connected.

Individual commands: `pnpm --filter @enspatium/server generate:openapi` and `pnpm --filter @enspatium/web generate:api`. Verify with `pnpm --filter @enspatium/server test` and `pnpm --filter @enspatium/web test:api`.
